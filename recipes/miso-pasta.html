<h2>Miso Pasta!!</h2>

<body>

    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>16 ounces spaghetti, linguine or bucatini</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white (or red) miso</li>
        <li>4 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (1 packed cup)</li>
        <li>Kizami nori, furikake or thinly sliced seaweed snacks, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1½ cups pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>Add the butter, miso and 1¼ cups pasta water to the pot and whisk over medium heat until miso breaks down and liquid is uniform, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the pasta and Parmesan and cook, stirring vigorously with tongs until cheese is melted and sauce emulsifies. (The key word here is “vigorously.” To achieve a silky smooth pasta instead of a gloppy one, put your cacio e pepe skills to work.)
    </li>
    <li>Divide among shallow bowls and sprinkle with nori or furikake, if using.
    </li>
    </ol>
